## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor's Insure landing page front-end coding challenge.

The challenge can be found <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/insure-landing-page-uTU68JV8">here</a>.

The solution is still in work in progress. I'm now in the process of making the website more mobile friendly.

## My Design - Figma

Since I'm a free frontend mentor user, I had to create the design of the landing page myself.
To save you the trouble of making one yourself <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/zJpPMbmggtGAbgDLq4v0Bf/FrontEndMentor-Insurence">here</a> is my design document.
